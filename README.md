# gRPC and Remote Procedure Call (With Protobuf) - Chat Server using go

**gRPC**, which stands for Google Remote Procedure Call, is a powerful framework that enables efficient and scalable communication between client and server applications. It is backed by Protocol Buffers (Protobuf), a language-agnostic data serialization format developed by Google. With gRPC, you can define services and message types using Protobuf, and it automatically generates the necessary code in various programming languages, including Go, to facilitate seamless communication between distributed systems.

**Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** is a protocol that allows programs to invoke functions or procedures in remote servers as if they were local functions, abstracting away the complexities of network communication. 
By using gRPC with Protobuf, we can define the structure of their services and data using a concise and efficient language, and gRPC takes care of generating the client and server code for them.

**the process involves** defining the chat service and message types in a Protobuf file, generating Go code from the Protobuf definitions, implementing the server-side logic to handle chat operations, and creating a client to connect to the server and perform chat-related RPC calls. By leveraging the power of gRPC and the flexibility of Protobuf, developers can easily build a robust and efficient chat server that can handle communication between multiple clients and the server seamlessly.
